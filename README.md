EDANYA Research Group
=====================

The research group on **Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis and Applications (EDANYA)**  of the University of MÃ¡laga has a wide experience in Numerical Analysis. The group focuses its research in the numerical simulation of geophysical fluids by means of the numerical solution of hydrodynamic models. Besides the software development, the group has implemented a versatile web interface for intensive computation in CPU and GPU clusters.


Our more active lines of research are:

* **Numerical Analysis of systems of Partial Differential Equations**:

    Finite Element Methods  
    Finite Volume Methods

* **Geophysical flows simulation**:  
    Shallow-Water models  
    Sediment transport  
    Submarine and aerial avalanches  
    Tsunami generation, propagation and inland penetration  
    Oceanographic applications  
    Hydrodynamic-Biology coupled models  
    Pollutant transport  
    Hazard assessment (dambreaks, avalanches, floods, ...)
